Salts are a defence against rainbow-tables. 



They are unique strings . 

That are added to a password . 


Hash ( salt + password ) ====> less skewed

I still have a lot of confusion about why salt is openly stored along with the hashedpassword .

  : They aren't secrets
  : Creating a rainbow table is really that expensive ? 
  : How does a rainbow table creation time grows by introducing  SALTS ? 
  : What if I don't want passwords of all the users but only a single user.
  : How do SALTS defeat the purpose of RAINBOW TABLES ? 


  :Based on all these figure out how'd you crack a long password that uses a long  (password + salt)  hash . Just through the hash. Is it ever possible ? 

  :Can you try to boil this down to the core Ideas ? 
  :Can you try to get a good grasp of these core principles & then see how fast can you intuitively think about these topics.
